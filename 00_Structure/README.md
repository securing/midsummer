# Writeup structure

Before we move on to actual challenges, I should explain how the following writeup is structured.

## Stages and Tasks

Because I don't like the naming convention used on TryHackMe, I decided to implement my own.

Each **Stage** (formally known as `Task` on TryHackMe) is divided into **Tasks** (formally knows as `Questions`) that you need to complete in order to gain points. 

It's important to note that you **don't need to finish all tasks** before you can unlock the next stage. In fact, Stages don't form a linear progression system, although they tend to increase in difficulty and complexity the lower on the list they are. The only prerequisite for a given Stage (if any) is the access to particular user account.

All Stages focus on finding a way to gain access into an user account. Stages are accompanied by Tasks, of which at least 1 requires you to have already hacked into particular account in order to complete.

## Stage breakdown
Article explain every stage will be divided with following sections in mind

### Exploitation

This section is devoted to the thought process behind finding and exploiting the vulnerability in question. It is divided into 4 sub-sections:

- **Briefing** - contains information about the task, straight from the CTF website
- **Reconnaissance** - looking for the Attack Vector to exploit
- **Attack Vector** - description of the found vulnerability
- **Execution** - using the Attack Vector to gain access into the user account

This section focuses on how to gain access into user account and might accidently solve some of the Tasks - their solution will **always** be posted in a section below regardless.

### Prevention

This section talks about the weakpoint of the system, how the vulnerability we previously used came to life and how to prevent it from appearing in the first place.

### Tasks

This section explains how to complete all the Tasks in the current Stage.
