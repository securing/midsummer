Subject: Request for IdP and SSO sign-in fix ASAP

Dear Boruta,

I am writing to request your assistance in fixing the IdP and SSO sign-in for our company app. As you may be aware, our main tech specialist, Twardowski, is currently missing, and we are in urgent need of your expertise to resolve this issue.
I understand that this is a complex problem, but I have every confidence that you and your team can find a solution quickly and efficiently. The security and usability of our app are critical to our operations, and we cannot afford any downtime or disruptions.
Please let me know as soon as possible what steps you will take to address this issue, and how long you anticipate it will take to resolve. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to working with you to ensure the continued success of our company.

Sincerely,
Midsummer Corp CEO
